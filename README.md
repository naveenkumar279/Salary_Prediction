# 💼 Salary Prediction 🚀

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on features such as **Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience, Country, and Race** using popular models like **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

🔍 **Objective**:
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on salary-related data.
- Build and evaluate **predictive models** to estimate salaries.
- Compare **Linear Regression** vs **Random Forest Regressor** performance.
- Visualize salary distribution across **Countries and Races**.

## 🔎 **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Cleaning** 🧹
   - Handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical features.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📈
   - Distribution plots.
   - Boxplots for salary vs. Country & Race.

3. **Model Building** 🏗️
   - **Linear Regression Model**.
   - **Random Forest Regressor**.

4. **Model Evaluation & Comparison** ⚖️
   - **R² Score**, **MAE**, **MSE**, **RMSE** comparison.
   - Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Salaries.

5. **Salary Prediction Based on Country and Race** 🌍

---

> ✅ **Random Forest Regressor performed better with lower error rates and higher R² score.**
